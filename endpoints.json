We never refer to him as Midnight we all just call him Mini because he was so tiny when we got him, not so much now, he's a chonky boy! Both cats are moggies, Twyla is black and white and Mini is black with a tiny white patch on his chest. They are in double digits but both are still very active. Twyla's favourite toy is a tennis ball she stole from a neighbour. Mini's not really a fan of toys he prefers playing with the dogs especially his best friend Kimiko, they play fight and chase each other around the house a lot, he particularly enjoys hiding behind doors and jumping on Kimiko when she comes in.",
